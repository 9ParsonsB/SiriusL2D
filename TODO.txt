Make lua script (compiled) that downloads love for a 
platform (all/one (choose)) and then compiles the game 
into a .love and then a .exe / .app (mac) / .love for 
linux method (read below)

Note about linux
the best way to distribute LOVE games on *nix is to 
just distribute LOVE with the game and then just run 
"love $GAME.love" (like normal, just automated and on 
the .love [zip] rather than the folder)
